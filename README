Introduction
------------
cccl is a wrapper around Microsoft Visual C++'s cl.exe.  It
converts Unix compiler parameters into parameters understood by cl.exe.
cccl's main use is for using Unix build processes with Microsoft compilers.
Using cccl in conjunction with ports of Unix utilities, it is possible to 
build many Unix packages using MSVC, without modifying the build process.

Full Documentation
------------------
Documentation, including how to use autotools with MSVC by using cccl, is
now included!  The documentation is in HTML and can be found in 
doc/html/index.html.

Motivation
----------
Why would I build a wrapper script to make cl.exe act like gcc, when
gcc is available for Windows?  I had a cross-platform project that I wanted
to use autoconf/automake/libtool for the build process.  The obvious thing
to do would have been to use gcc on all platforms.  But on Windows I was
using some third-party libraries that didn't work with gcc, only with 
MSVC.  By creating cccl, I was able to use the same build process with the
MSVC compiler, with only minimal changes to the build process.  This 
saved a great deal of time.

Even though it's extremely simple and stupid, it saved me a lot of hassle
in the build process.  I tried to look for an already existing program to
do this, but none existed (that I could find).  I decided that since it 
proved so useful to me, I should release it to the world.

Installing
----------
cccl requires ports of the following Unix utilities:
  - bash
  - sed
  - tr

cccl is known to work on Cygwin and MinGW.

You can either copy the cccl script to somewhere on your system, or you can
do a "./configure && make install" if you have a Unixish enough environment
installed.  The configure and Makefile don't really do anything but copy
the cccl script, though.

Usage
-----
cccl will take it's command line parameters and convert the command line
parameters to something understood by cl.exe for both compiling and linking.

cccl can display the command line it is invoking before invoking by passing the
--cccl-verbose option or setting the environment variable V=1.

cccl assumes cl.exe are in your path.

If cccl sees a C++ file with an extension other than .cpp (i.e. .cc, .C, or
.cxx), then cccl will prepend a "/Tp" option to the cl.exe command line to force
cl.exe to process it as a C++ source file.

Other command line parameters are passed unchanged.
